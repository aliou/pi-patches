# pi-tui -- markdown code-block rendering patch

## What this patch does

Reworks how fenced code blocks are rendered in `@earendil-works/pi-tui`'s
`Markdown` component (`dist/components/markdown.js`).

Before: code blocks were drawn with ``` fences and a trailing blank line:

```
```js
  const x = 1
```
```

After: code blocks are drawn as an indented block with a tinted background and
top/bottom padding bars (`▀` / `▄`), with no surrounding blank lines:

```
▀▀▀▀
  const x = 1
▄▄▄
```

### Changes

- Adds `renderCodeBlock(code, lang, availableWidth)` which renders the block
  with `▀`/`▄` padding bars (via `theme.codeBlockPaddingTop` /
  `theme.codeBlockPaddingBottom`, falling back to `theme.codeBlock`), indents
  the code by two spaces, and pads each line to the full width so the tinted
  background spans the whole block.
- `renderToken` now takes a `prevTokenType` argument (threaded from the render
  loop) and delegates `code` tokens to `renderCodeBlock`.
- The `space` token handler skips blank lines that sit directly adjacent to a
  code block (`prevTokenType === "code" || nextTokenType === "code"`), since
  the block now supplies its own padding.

## Files

- `patch.diff` — unified diff applied to the installed package's
  `dist/components/markdown.js`.
- `test.mjs` — imports the patched `Markdown` by package name
  (`@earendil-works/pi-tui/dist/components/markdown.js`) and asserts the new
  rendering. Fails on unpatched code, so it actually guards the patch.

## How it is applied & tested

`manifest.json` lists this directory under `@earendil-works/pi-tui`:

```json
"@earendil-works/pi-tui": [
  "pi-tui--markdown-code-block"
]
```

`pnpm patches:sync` flattens that package's patches, in manifest order, into
`combined/pi-tui.diff` and points `pnpm `patchedDependencies`` at it,
because pnpm accepts only one patch file per package. `pnpm install` in
`pnpm install` then applies the combined diff automatically, and the test imports the
patched package by name — no extraction, apply, or dep-linking step at test time.
Nix applies each patch directory in succession instead; both produce identical
output.

Run: `pnpm -C patches install && pnpm test:patches`.

## Testing against a new pi-tui release

Authored against 0.80.2 and verified against 0.84.1. The `Patches` workflow
runs a nightly job that bumps `package.json` to the latest published
Pi release (via `scripts/bump-pi-version.mjs`), reinstalls, and re-runs this
test. If the patch no longer applies to the new version, `pnpm install` fails
and the job goes red — rebase `patch.diff` onto the new source.

To check manually: `PI_VERSION=<ver> node scripts/bump-pi-version.mjs &&
pnpm -C patches install && pnpm test:patches`.
